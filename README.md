# Python Weather App
## Project B
Develop a command-line application that provides weather forecasts for different cities using an external weather API. Implement this application following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

### How it works?!
This app uses OpenWeather API. Request to this API uses a User API Key to authenticate and get a response.
This app will ask user to input the ZipCode of the city and will return City Name, Current Temperature, and Current Forecast.

Advanced features like 5-day weather are coming soon!
