# Python Weather App
## Project B
### Objective:
Develop a command-line application that provides weather forecasts for different cities using an external weather API. Implement this application following Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

### Features:

### Fetch Weather: 
The application should allow users to enter a name of a city and retrieve the current weather forecast for that location.
### Display results: 
show the weather forecast information clearly and concisely
### Error handling: 
properly handle potential errors, such as invalid city names or issues with the weather API
### Test Cases: 
Develop comprehensive test cases covering all functionalities.
### Hint: 
Use a testing framework - follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.
For each feature or functionality, write one or more tests before writing the code.
Run tests frequently to ensure they pass and the application behaves as expected.

### Improvements:
Extend the application to provide a 5-day forecast or hourly forecasts.
Allow users to choose units of measurement(e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit)
